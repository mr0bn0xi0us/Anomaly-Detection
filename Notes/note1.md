# Academic Notes on Anomaly Detection Algorithm

## Introduction to Anomaly Detection

- **Definition:** Anomaly detection is an unsupervised learning algorithm designed to identify unusual or anomalous events within an unlabeled dataset of normal occurrences.
  
- **Example:** A practical application of anomaly detection is in aircraft engine manufacturing, where ensuring reliability is crucial. The algorithm analyzes features such as heat generation (x1) and vibration intensity (x2) to detect any anomalies in newly manufactured engines.

## Understanding the Problem

- **Data Features:** After an aircraft engine is manufactured, various features (e.g., x1 and x2) are computed, representing characteristics like heat and vibration.

- **Data Distribution:** Since defective engines are rare, the dataset primarily consists of normal engine behavior. The challenge is to determine if a new engine, represented by feature vector Xtest, is similar to the ones in the training set.

## Anomaly Detection Algorithm Process

1. **Data Representation:**
   - Plot the examples (data points) of normal engine behavior based on features x1 and x2.

2. **Identification of Anomalies:**
   - If a new engine's feature vector Xtest deviates significantly from the established data distribution, it is flagged as a potential anomaly.

3. **Density Estimation:**
   - Anomaly detection commonly employs density estimation to model the probability distribution of features in the training set.

4. **Probability Computation:**
   - For a new test example Xtest, compute the probability (p of Xtest) based on the learned model.

5. **Anomaly Decision:**
   - If p of Xtest is less than a predefined threshold (epsilon), flag the example as an anomaly; otherwise, consider it normal.

## Applications of Anomaly Detection

1. **Fraud Detection:**
   - Used in online platforms to detect anomalous user activities, prompting additional security measures without automatically blocking accounts.

2. **Manufacturing Quality Control:**
   - Applied in various manufacturing processes to identify anomalies in products such as aircraft engines, printed circuit boards, smartphones, and more.

3. **Computer Systems Monitoring:**
   - Monitors machines in clusters and data centers by analyzing features like memory usage, disk accesses, and CPU load to identify potential issues or security threats.

4. **Telecommunications:**
   - Implemented in the telecom industry to detect unusual behavior in cell towers, facilitating prompt maintenance for improved network coverage.

5. **Financial Transactions:**
   - Utilized to identify fraudulent financial transactions by detecting patterns that deviate from normal spending behavior.

## Importance and Practical Use

- **Widespread Application:** Despite limited discussion, anomaly detection is widely employed in various industries, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness.

- **Personal Experience:** The speaker shares personal experiences applying anomaly detection in telecommunications and finance, emphasizing its practical utility.
